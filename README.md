# v1.0.0
Added new filters in the Clan's Armory. You can now filter by item type (Weapons, and Armor), by item (specific type of item i.e. Bows), and by level (the actual level of the item). If you want to search for something by just one of these criteria leave the input(s) blank. So if you want just Bows then set the item select to bows and filter.

# v1.0.1
When leaving the Clan modal the filters will be reset.
This script now loads when the window is ready to help prevent undefined values.

# v1.0.1
Added CSS
Added Power criteria
Surprises!
